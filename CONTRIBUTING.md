# Contributing to Awesome AI Learning Tools

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! Whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new AI learning tool, or suggesting improvements, your help is appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the GitHub page.

2. **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your changes separate from the main project until they're ready to be merged. A good branch name describes the changes you're making, e.g., `add-learning-tool` or `fix-typo`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-learning-tool
   ```

3. **Make your changes:** Edit the `README.md` file with your additions or corrections. Please follow the existing format and style. When adding a new learning tool, make sure to include:

    * The tool name, linked to its official website.
    * Proper category icons and metadata (skill level, learning style, pricing, platform).
    * A concise description highlighting AI features and target audience.
    * Categorize the tool appropriately under the relevant section. If a new category is needed, please create one and maintain alphabetical order.

4. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise message explaining what you've done.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new XYZ learning tool"
   ```

5. **Push your branch:** Push your branch to your forked repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin add-learning-tool
   ```

6. **Create a pull request:** Go to the original repository and click the "New pull request" button. Select your forked repository and branch. Provide a clear title and description of your changes in the pull request.

7. **Review and merge:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may suggest changes or ask for clarification. Once the review is complete, your changes will be merged into the main project.

## Guidelines

* **Keep it consistent:** Follow the existing format and style of the `README.md` file. This includes formatting, capitalization, and punctuation.
* **Use proper icon notation:** Always include relevant icons using our legend system: `🎓 🟢 📖 💰 🌐`
* **Alphabetical order:** Maintain alphabetical order within each category of tools. This makes it easier to find specific tools.
* **Accurate information:** Ensure that all information is accurate and up-to-date. Double-check links and descriptions before submitting your changes.
* **One tool per line:** List each tool on a separate line for better readability.
* **Clear descriptions:** Write concise and informative descriptions for each tool. Explain what the tool does, what AI features it offers, and who it's for.
* **Quality criteria:** Only add tools that are genuinely AI-powered and provide educational value. Avoid tools that just market themselves as "AI" without meaningful AI features.

## Tool Quality Standards

Before adding a new tool, please ensure it meets these criteria:

* **AI-Powered:** The tool must meaningfully use artificial intelligence to enhance the learning experience
* **Educational Value:** Clear learning objectives and educational outcomes
* **Accessibility:** Reasonably accessible to the target audience (web-based, mobile apps, or affordable pricing)
* **Active Development:** The tool should be actively maintained and updated
* **Reputation:** Positive user feedback and credible reviews
